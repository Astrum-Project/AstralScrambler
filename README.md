# AstralScrambler
Assembly information scrambler to bypass static detection

# Usage
- This is a plugin. Put it in your plugins folder
- All mods and plugins will be scrambled
  - Unless they have "Loader" in their file name

# Note
- Currently this seems to break mods that depend on UIExpansionKit
- Currently this will irreparably modify all of your assemblies beyond recognition, please make backups prior to use
- :trollface:
